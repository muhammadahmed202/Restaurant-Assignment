    <p class="roll">A chicken roll is a delicious and convenient fast-food option that combines flavorful chicken filling with a soft wrap. Marinated and grilled or cooked to perfection, the tender chicken is typically paired with fresh vegetables, sauces, and sometimes cheese. The entire mixture is then rolled up in a flatbread or tortilla. This portable and satisfying meal offers a harmonious blend of textures and tastes, making it a popular choice for those on the go or looking for a quick and tasty bite. Whether served as street food or in restaurants, chicken rolls are a favorite among food enthusiasts for their convenience and deliciousness.</p>
