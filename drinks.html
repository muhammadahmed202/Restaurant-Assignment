    <p class="drinks">Cold drinks, also known as soft drinks or sodas, are popular refreshing beverages enjoyed worldwide. Typically carbonated and available in a variety of flavors, these fizzy drinks offer a cool and satisfying experience. They are often served over ice to enhance their chilling effect. Whether enjoyed on a hot summer day or paired with a meal, cold drinks have become a ubiquitous and enjoyable part of social gatherings and daily life. However, it's essential to consume them in moderation due to their sugar content and potential impact on health.</p>
