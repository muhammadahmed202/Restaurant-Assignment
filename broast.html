    <p class="broast">Broast is a popular culinary delight, known for its crispy and flavorful chicken. The term "broast" is a combination of "broil" and "roast," indicating the cooking technique. Chicken pieces are marinated with a blend of spices, coated in a seasoned flour mixture, and then deep-fried to achieve a golden and crispy texture. The result is tender on the inside and deliciously crunchy on the outside. Often served with a side of fries or coleslaw, broast is a favorite fast-food option for those craving a tasty and satisfying meal.</p>
