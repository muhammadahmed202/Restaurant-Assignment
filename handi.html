    <p class="handi">Chicken Handi is a delectable Indian dish that showcases the rich and aromatic flavors of traditional spices combined with tender pieces of chicken. Cooked in a special handi, a traditional Indian cooking pot, this dish is known for its unique taste and creamy texture. The succulent chicken is marinated with a blend of spices and then slow-cooked in the handi, allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully. The result is a mouthwatering curry that is both spicy and flavorful. Garnished with fresh coriander and served hot with naan or rice, Chicken Handi is a favorite among those who appreciate the essence of authentic Indian cuisine.</p>
