    <p class="biryani">Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic South Asian dish made with basmati rice, meat (often chicken, mutton, or beef), and a blend of spices. The dish is layered and cooked to perfection, allowing the rice to absorb the rich flavors of the meat and spices. Biryani often includes ingredients like fried onions, mint, and saffron, providing a delicious blend of textures and tastes. This beloved dish is popular across various regions and is a centerpiece in many festive and celebratory meals.</p>
